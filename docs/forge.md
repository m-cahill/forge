## Authority and Update Rule

`docs/forge.md` is the active Ultimate Truth for FORGE. It records current project state, milestone status, material decisions, run outcomes, Kaggle submissions, CI posture, risks, and final candidate selection.

`docs/FORGE_ANCHOR.md` defines strategy and doctrine (canonical location: **`docs/FORGE_ANCHOR.md`**). If strategy changes materially, update this file first, then update `docs/FORGE_ANCHOR.md` only when the doctrine itself changes. Do not create duplicate anchor copies.

No milestone may close unless:
- this file is updated,
- the milestone summary exists,
- the milestone audit exists,
- all material evidence, hashes, CI state, submissions, and deferrals are recorded.

## 2. Current Strategy

FORGE is a solver-guided, artifact-first, audit-governed LoRA competition system. The core thesis: reproduce a strong public control adapter, build better verified data for hard/private-style categories, train specialists, and legally merge/compress them into a rank-32 adapter that preserves solved categories while improving unsolved ones.

**Active lane priorities:**
1. Lane A — Public control reproduction (mandatory first)
2. Lane B — Solver-guided synthetic data
3. Lane E — Documentation and prize eligibility (parallel from day one)

### M01 deliverables

| Deliverable | Status |
| ----------- | ------ |
| `pyproject.toml` / editable install | Met |
| CI workflow | Met — green on PR #2 |
| Boxed-answer metric + tests | Met — 61 tests |
| Package validator + tests | Met — 27 tests; rank >32 rejected |
| Public baseline intake | Met — no reproduction claim |
| Kaggle debug notebook | Met — repo + **interactive probe run** (2026-06-04) |
| Kaggle submission / score / reproduction | **Not claimed** |

### M01 Kaggle interactive probe (2026-06-04)

**Notebook:** `notebooks/forge_m01_kaggle_debug_probe.ipynb` (repo-first; run on Kaggle Interactive)  
**Mode:** Interactive · **Is Kaggle:** true · **Submissions used:** 0/5 → **limit 5/day**  
**Environment:** Python 3.12.13; Linux `6.6.122+`; CWD `/kaggle/working`; `/kaggle/input` has `competitions`  
**Disk:** ~19.5 GB free on `/kaggle/working` · **GPU:** none (`nvidia-smi` not found)  
**Torch:** 2.10.0+cpu · **CUDA:** false  
**Base model paths:** not attached — `nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b-bf16`, `nvidia-nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b-bf16` not visible  
**Debug artifact:** `/kaggle/working/tmp/forge_debug/probe_test.txt` (83 B; SHA256 `a8f624087fe0520a0c0c97f914e54f4e7b6478f750b85d5f9d8e971c6e360a8c`)

**Expected outputs:** diagnostics only (e.g. `/kaggle/working/tmp/forge_debug/probe_test.txt`).  
**Does not create:** `/kaggle/working/submission.zip` — that path is for a future submission notebook, not this probe.  
**Not a probe failure:** missing `submission.zip` after this run is **by design**.

**Non-claims:** no submission, no score, no package validity, no model inference, no submission readiness.

Evidence: [`docs/kaggle/kaggle_setup_evidence.md`](kaggle/kaggle_setup_evidence.md)

### Kaggle eligibility intake (owner 2026-06-04)

| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| Rules accepted / team joined | **Yes** |
| Verified via | Authenticated competition page / Rules or Submit UI |
| Submit UI accessible | **Yes** |
| Team name | not recorded |
| Additional UI notes | not recorded (zip constraints / warnings TBD) |

Evidence: [`docs/kaggle/kaggle_setup_evidence.md`](kaggle/kaggle_setup_evidence.md)

### Owner-action blockers

- **BQ-001:** **Resolved** — 5 submissions per day
- **BQ-003:** **Resolved** — rules accepted; team joined; Submit UI accessible
- **BQ-002:** **Resolved** — entry Jun 8, 2026; final Jun 15, 2026 11:59 PM UTC (owner live page)
- **Submit UI zip constraints:** **Open** — not yet recorded

Kaggle **submission is not authorized** without a validated package, local eval, and explicit owner go-ahead. Eligibility ≠ submission readiness.

### Next recommendation

1. **Owner:** Record Submit UI `submission.zip` constraints.  
2. **Cursor (M03):** Implement solver/trace factory on `forge/M03-solver-factory` (authorized).  
3. **Defer:** Kaggle submission until validated package + local eval on real candidates + owner go-ahead.

**Non-claims (M02):** no Kaggle submission, public/private score, training, inference, reproduced baseline, Kaggle-ready adapter, fixture holdout used for training.
